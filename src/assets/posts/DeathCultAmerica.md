# -Death Cult America-

### *How Right Wing Religious Extremism Makes Our Lives Worse*

My own personal issues aside and despite the gravity of the intro you've read in this book I'm in fact not a nihilist! I actually am hopeful for what our future looks like at least specifically as a country, country in this case being the United States of America. Oh please, a book that comes default in English with all the arrogance of that first chapter you knew good in hell well I was American before I said that don't lie to me. But broadly speaking I feel like there are issues all over the world and the main crux of that is conservatism, Specifically Religious Conservatism.

Religious conservatism has led to Israel dehumanizing the Palestinians to the point of genocidal rhetoric. Religious conservatism has The American Evangelical supporting Israel's actions for the purposes of sacrificing all Jews to start the rapture. Religious conservatism is why the Indian government murders Sihks on foreign soil. And religious conservatism is why Myanmar Buddhists ethnically cleanse Muslims from their country. I am an atheist and while I do view religion as silly fundamentally at the end of the day I don't actually mind or want to tell people how to live their life. And in fact religion doesn't need to force other people to follow. Many faith in fact encourage against it The problem is conservatism. Conservatism requires ingroups and outgroups, It requires an almost performative adherence to the ideologies you believe. 

Conservatism doesn't even wish to conserve the current structure; they hate it; they hate the current existence of society and glorify a past that only exists in their mind and ignores the realities of that past. The American Conservative focuses so heavily on the ideal 1950s depiction of American life ignoring the fact that high corporate tax rates, robust social programs, and the exclusion of black and brown people from those programs via red lining(among other policies) are what allowed people's grandparents to buy houses for $14 and a handful of raspberries. It's no coincidence that when the credit system was created in 1987 homeownership has continued a downward trend among the youngest Americans.

 But I want to bring it back to religious conservatism because while conservatism as an ideology and as a movement has led to the current state of awfulness that is existence as a not rich person in the United States of America it is the religious conservatives that are the worst. And they are the worst simply for the fact that because they believe that the rapture is upon us and at the end times are soon to come, why fix our economy to work for working people? Why have universal health care? We're all going to be dead soon anyways. What's the point? Well you would probably rebuttal with "just because we're all going to die soon doesn't mean that we all have to suffer beforehand". And that dear reader is where the true insidiousness of the American Evangelical comes into play because in Protestant thought suffering is virtuous struggle is virtuous The arc type of the hardworking Protestant who struggles and suffers every day and works their hardest will eventually be rewarded in the kingdom of heaven. You don't need to be healthy. You don't need to have your needs met because when you die all of that will be taken care of. What is 85 years of suffering for an eternity in heaven?

Now if you're an evangelical that's a great deal, I'd take that deal. But if you aren't an American Evangelical and you are say everybody else in the country/the world, What you're left with is no health care, abysmal wages, abysmal work conditions, and an environment that is routinely trying to kill you with catastrophic weather events that happen in higher numbers due to climate change. The US government is effectively held hostage by a death cult who fight against making things better for anybody because if they do they're just hurting people's chances of getting to heaven which is going to happen any day now anyways. And because you pair the religious extremism of a death cult with the arrogance of American individualism at no point will any of these people think what if we're wrong, a routine turn a phrase used by evangelicals who try to convert non-believers like me but fail to realize that they have no empirical evidence for their beliefs and I have 30 years of climate research proving me right. But when your brain has the heightened fear receptors that come with a conservative worldview and the condition to believe things without any evidence (having faith) All the evidence in the world to the contrary won't help because "God told me so" and "you're an agent for the devil" will suffice.
