Pet Safe Bug Spray And Cleaning Fluid

1 tbsp of Dawn dish soap 
1 tsp of cinnamon 
1 tsp of baking soda 
2 tbsp of vinegar 
1 gallon of water 

Put the gallon of water in a pot and bring to a boil 
Mix in vinegar and cinnamon and cover with lid until water browns from the cinnamon steeping 

Take your spray bottle filled with water, measure out the contents of the spray bottle into a separate bowl until you know how many cups of water approximately your spray bottle can hold 

Dump the water out of the separate bowl, and stir the hot water on the stove once the cinnamon particles have settled to the bottom use a cup measure to cup out water from the stove to the bowl equal to your spray bottle capacity(Make sure to use a hand strainer to catch any stray cinnamon particles)

Once added to the separate bowl mix in your dish soap and baking soda. And funnel into your spray bottle
